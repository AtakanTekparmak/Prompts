To complete this task, I need to perform the 
following steps:
1. Retrieve tweets containing a hashtag related to 
MMA.
2. Perform sentiment analysis on those tweets.
3. Send an email with the results of the sentiment 
analysis to the specified recipient.

[
    { "name": "get_tweets_by_hashtag", "kwargs": 
{"hashtag": "#MMA", "count": 100}, "returns": 
["tweets"]},
    { "name": "get_sentiment_analysis", "kwargs": 
{"text": "$tweets$"}, "returns": ["sentiment"]}
]

I will now send an email to your friend with the 
sentiment analysis results. Please provide a subject 
and body for the email.
