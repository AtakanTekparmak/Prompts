To accomplish this task, I will need to perform the 
following steps:

1. Retrieve tweets containing a relevant hashtag 
related to MMA.
2. Perform sentiment analysis on these tweets to 
determine the overall sentiment towards MMA.
3. Send an email with the subject "Current Sentiment 
about MMA in Twitter" and the analyzed sentiment to 
my friend (jasper3131@gmail.com).
