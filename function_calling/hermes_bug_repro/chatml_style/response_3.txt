To fulfill this request, I will use the following 
functions:
1. get_tweets_by_hashtag: To retrieve tweets 
containing a hashtag related to MMA.
2. get_sentiment_analysis: To perform sentiment 
analysis on the retrieved tweets and determine their 
positiveness scale.
3. send_email: To send an email with the current 
sentiment about MMA in Twitter to the user's friend.

Here is how I will proceed:
1. Call "get_tweets_by_hashtag" function to get 
tweets related to MMA.
2. Use "get_sentiment_analysis" on these tweets to 
determine their sentiment.
3. Compile a summary of this sentiment and use 
"send_email" to send it to the user's friend at 
jasper3131@gmail.com.
