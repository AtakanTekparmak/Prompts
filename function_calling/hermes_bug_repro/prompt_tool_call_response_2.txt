To accomplish this task, I will perform the following steps:
1. Retrieve tweets containing a hashtag related to MMA.
2. Perform sentiment analysis on those tweets to determine their overall 
sentiment.
3. Send an email to your friend with the results of the sentiment 
analysis.

Here are the functions that will be used for each step:

1. get_tweets_by_hashtag: This function retrieves tweets containing a 
given hashtag. In this case, we'll use #MMA as the hashtag parameter.
2. get_sentiment_analysis: This function performs sentiment analysis on a 
list of strings (tweets in this case). It returns an integer value 
representing the positiveness scale from -10 to +10.

Once I have the results from both functions, I will concatenate them into 
a message and send it via email using the send_email function. 

The final output for this task would be:
[
    { "name": "get_tweets_by_hashtag", "kwargs": {"hashtag": "MMA", 
"count": 10}, "returns": ["tweets"]},
    { "name": "get_sentiment_analysis", "kwargs": {"text": "$tweets$"}, 
"returns": ["sentiment"]},
    { "name": "send_email", "kwargs": {"subject": "Sentiment Analysis of 
MMA on Twitter", "body": "The sentiment analysis results for the hashtag 
#MMA on Twitter is: $sentiment$.", "recipient": "jasper3131@gmail.com"}, "returns": []}
]
