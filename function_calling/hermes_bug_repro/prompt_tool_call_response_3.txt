To fulfill this request, I will need to perform two 
primary tasks: 
1. Retrieve tweets with a specific hashtag related to
MMA.
2. Analyze the sentiment of these tweets.

Once I have determined the general sentiment towards 
MMA from the tweets, I can then proceed to send an 
email to your friend (jasper3131@gmail.com) about it.
