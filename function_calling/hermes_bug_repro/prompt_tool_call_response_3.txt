To find the current sentiment about MMA in Twitter and send it to your friend, I will 
follow these steps:

2. Perform sentiment analysis on the retrieved tweets.
3. Send an email to your friend with the analyzed sentiment.

Now, let me execute the necessary functions:

    { "name": "send_email", "kwargs": {"subject": "Current Sentiment about MMA in 
Twitter", "body": "The sentiment analysis shows a score of $sentiment$. This is the most
recent sentiment collected.", "recipient": "jasper3131@gmail.com"}, "returns": []}
